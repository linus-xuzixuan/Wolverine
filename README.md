# Wolverine
Directly remoted from my MacBook Pro.

This is a C++ program for "狼人杀" in Chinese. I don't really know how to translate this name correctly.


File information:

Clean.bash: A command to clear the screen. Will probably be deprecated later.

Distrib.lrs: Records the number of different identities ffor different numbers of players. Will be updated after I complete the remaining code on other files.

Execute.h: Open a specified file. Co-operates with clean.bash. Also will probably be deprecated later.

Player.h: Interface and implementation for class Player.

LRS.cpp: Main program.
