# Wolverine

This is a C++ program for "狼人杀" in Chinese. I don't really know how to translate this name correctly.

Warning: This program is now only functional for 6-player mode.

The logger is now complete and has been embedded into master. Work on master resumed.

File information:

Clean.bash: A command to clear the screen. Will probably be deprecated later.

Distrib.lrs: Records the number of different identities for different numbers of players. Will be updated after I complete the remaining code on other files.

Execute.h: Open a specified file. Co-operates with clean.bash. Also will probably be deprecated later.

Player.h: Interface and implementation for class Player.

LRS.cpp: Main program.

Logger.h: Implementations of logging functions.

This version of Distrib.lrs will be the standard, and PRs concerning additions will be welcome.

Basic format:

<Total number of players> <Number of wolverines> <Number of villagers> <Presence of powers>
  
Inside "Presence of powers", W, P, H, G each for Witch, Predictor, Hunter, and Guard. Add one space between each.

The number of players should be put in a increasing order one by one, with no blank lines in between.

Error code solutions:

1: Enter a correct number of players (currently between 6 and 12)

2: Put Distrib.lrs it into the place where you are starting your Shell (user home folder mostly)

3: Wrong format of Distrib.lrs. Please follow the format above.

4: There are letters other than W, P, H, G in Distrib.lrs. Please check your file.
